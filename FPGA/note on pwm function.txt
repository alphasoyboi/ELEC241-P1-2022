i've just looked into PWM a little and i think i've found a pretty simple explanation. 
if you think of it as producing a wave of the output strength, the period is the frequency of the wave, and the duty cycle is the percentage of the period where the signal is high.
since we're being told to feed it a duty cycle of the same resolution as the period, i think that what we're setting is the fixed length of it.

assuming i'm right, which i'll check with nick when i can, we can write this for the controller:

for(int i = 0; i < period; i++) begin
	if(duty_cycle >= i) begin
		if(clockwise = 1'b1) begin
			motor2 = 1'b1;
			motor1 = 1'b0;
		end
		else begin
			motor1 = 1'b1;
			motor2 = 1'b0;
		end
	end
	else begin
		motor1 = 1'b0;
		motor2 = 1'b0;
	end
end
