# starter code for ELEC241 P1 2022

In this repository, you will find the files needed to get started

* FPGA - starter project for Quartus
* MCU - starter workspace for Mbed Studio
* Hardware - datasheets + files used for testing your hardware
* lib - Leave this. Files used by Quartus


Should should use this as a starting point for your coursework.
All pin mappings have been setup and tested so you can focus on your logic.

Do not use a fork of this repository for your coursework as it is public (a fork will also have to be public). Instead, click the "Use this template" button to create your own private repository. This will not inherit the git history (you don't want my random commits!)

The Hardware folder contains pre-built Mbed and FPGA binaries you can use to program your boards to check your hardware is constructed correctly. Always program the MCU first.

## Tasks
We suggest you do the following:

* Before connecting the ribbon cable to the Nucleo board, program the MCU with one of the test binaries (safety precaution)
* Complete construction of your cables and boards
* Connect everything in accordance with the image in the coursework spec
* Use the test binaries in the Hardware folder to check your hardware. Read the README files in each
* If all works, proceed to click the "Use this template" button and create your own private repository. Make sure you add your group members so they too can access it. 
   * At some point, you will need to add the staff as well. Watch out for an announcement about this

## Reporting Problems
If you find a problem with any of these files, please do one of the following:

* Click "issues" above and report
* Clone (or fork) the repository, make the correction, and push back a "Pull Request". Try not to push back too many changes in one go.

Both the above will be reviewed by the tutors and addressed as appropriate.
