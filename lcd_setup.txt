Setup for display controller

Please read the datasheet carefully and look at the timing diagrams.

Note the various values for time delays - one of them is zero!

On Power up:        Wait 50 ms
Init sequence:
    Send 00111000   Wait 60 us 8 bits, 2lines, 5x8 dots (no busy flag available)
    Send 00111000   Wait 60 us 8 bits, 2lines, 5x8 dots busy flag available from now on
    Send 00111000   Wait 60 us 8 bits, 2lines, 5x8 dots 
    Send 00001100   Wait 60 us Display ON, no cursor, no blink
    Send 00000001   Wait 2 ms  Clear display (note the long delay)
    Send 00000110   Wait 60 us  Entry mode set with increment
    Send 10000000   Wait 60 Set cursor position (Top left in this case)

You can now use the values of RS and R/W to locate the cursor and write values to the DDRAM

There are several variations of datasheets out on the internet and some have different 
init sequences, the sequence above seems to work for the Winstar 2 x 16 LCD that we
are using. There is one that details the Hitachi HD44780 and this explains the working
in much more detail. Where there are differences - use the Winstar data.

The LCD is a very slow device compared to the Nucleo board and the FPGA. If the timings 
are wrong it tends to sulk and not display anything.

The delay used in Modelsim (e.g. #10 ps) is for simulation only it won't work in Quartus.

Use timers or simply count clock cycles, the clock is running at 50 MHz.

Here is the table for using RS and R/W

    RS      R/W
-----------------
    0        0      Write to Instruction Register - send a command
    0        1      Read busy flag on DB7 
    1        0      Write data to DDRAM or CGRAM - this is what is displayed
    1        1      Read data from DDRAM or CGRAM
